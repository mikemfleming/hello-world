# HAPI

- Prefers configurization of customization
- Authentication and authorization are built in.
- "Battle tested"
- Uses plugins
- High level of abstraction away from HTTP req/res
- Detailed error messaging (uses Boom)
- Easier to test ( server.inject(actual, expected) )
- Reply as a function instead of a method on req/res
